### Framework Descriptions

- **Playwright Java BDD**: This framework allows you to write behavior-driven tests in Java using Playwright. It supports multiple browsers and provides a rich API for testing web applications.
  
- **Selenium WebDriver**: A widely used framework for automating web applications. It provides a set of tools for writing tests in various programming languages, including Java.
  
- **TestNG**: A testing framework inspired by JUnit. It introduces new functionalities that make it more powerful and easier to use.
  
- **JUnit 5**: The latest version of the popular testing framework for Java. It provides a rich set of annotations and features for writing tests.
  
- **Cucumber-JVM**: This framework supports behavior-driven development (BDD) for Java applications. It allows you to write tests in plain language, making it easier for non-technical stakeholders to understand.

## Installation Instructions

To get started with any of the frameworks listed, follow these general steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Use the following command to clone the repository.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LucakovaM/automation-frameworks-catalog.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Desired Framework**: Change to the directory of the framework you want to use.

   ```bash
   cd automation-frameworks-catalog/playwright-java-bdd-sample
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: Most frameworks require specific dependencies. Check the `README.md` file in each framework's directory for detailed installation instructions.

4. **Run Tests**: Follow the usage guidelines to execute tests.

## Usage Guidelines

Each framework has its own usage guidelines. Below are general instructions for using the frameworks in this catalog.

### Playwright Java BDD

1. **Create Feature Files**: Define your tests in `.feature` files using Gherkin syntax.

2. **Implement Step Definitions**: Write Java classes that implement the steps defined in your feature files.

3. **Run Tests**: Use the command line or an IDE to run your tests.

### Selenium WebDriver

1. **Set Up WebDriver**: Ensure you have the appropriate WebDriver for your browser.

2. **Write Tests**: Create Java classes that use the Selenium API to automate browser actions.

3. **Execute Tests**: Run your tests using your preferred method.

### TestNG

1. **Create Test Classes**: Write Java classes annotated with TestNG annotations.

2. **Run Tests**: Execute tests through an IDE or command line.

### JUnit 5

1. **Write Test Cases**: Use JUnit annotations to define test cases in Java classes.

2. **Run Tests**: Use your IDE or a build tool like Maven or Gradle.

### Cucumber-JVM

1. **Define Scenarios**: Write scenarios in `.feature` files.

2. **Implement Steps**: Create Java classes for step definitions.

3. **Execute Tests**: Run your tests through your IDE or command line.
